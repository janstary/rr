.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs register machines.
These are simple machines that operate on an array of numbered registers
and recognize the following instructions:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx -compact
.It Ic i Ns Ar r
Increment register
.Ar r .
.It Ic d Ns Ar r
Decrement register
.Ar r .
.It Ic j Ns Ar n
Jump
.Ar n
instructions (positive or negative).
.El
.Pp
The registers contain non-negative integers.
The
.Ic i
instruction increments the value in the given register.
The
.Ic d
instruction decrements the value in the given register if positive
and skips the next instruction;
if the current value in the register is zero, the register is not changed.
With the
.Ic j
instruction, the registers are not changed:
the machine jumps the given number of instructions
forward or backward in the list of instructions.
The machine halts if this would mean to jump out of the list,
or if there are no more instructions.
.Pp
The instructions are given in a
.Ar file ,
one instruction on one line.
After the instruction letter and a number (see examples below),
the rest of the line is ignored and can be used for comments.
.Pp
Once the instructions are parsed,
.Nm
reads lines of numbers separated by spaces from standard input,
initializing registers 1 to n with the numbers,
and runs the machine for every input line.
Empty input lines are ignored.
If and when the machine halts,
the content of register 0 is the result,
computing in effect an n-ary integer function.
By default,
.Nm
operates quietly and only prints out the result
for each input line of registers.
With the
.Fl q
option,
.Nm
stays quiet.
With the
.Fl v
option, it prints out the content of registers
and the instructions being performed in every step.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Enter an infinite loop:
.D1 j0
.Pp
Copy the number in register one into register zero:
.D1 d1	take one from register 1
.D1 j3	halt if register 1 exhausted
.D1 i0	give the one to register 0
.D1 j-3	repeat
